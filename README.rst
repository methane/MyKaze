MyKaze
=======

MyKaze is [Motor](https://github.com/mongodb/motor/) like bridge between
Tornado and PyMySQL.

You can access to MySQL from tornado without [background thread](https://gist.github.com/methane/2185380).

This package is in Proof of Concept status.
After PyMySQL has pluggable stream, MyKaze will be a plugin.
